# Embedded-Systems

The objective of this project is to design a custom master interface for Avalon bus that allow to take
pictures from a camera interface and save it to a specific address of memory. This sub-component is
part of a bigger system, composed of a camera and a LCD display, with the objective of implementing a
real-time camera system, which continuously takes and displays images.

Here is a overview of the system.
